Well, Peter Morris mentioned this was a fun technical test he did and it took him about an hour.

Naturally, I have overengineered my version to the point of almost insanity and spent more like four hours but it was fun doing the tests - they're pretty thorough - 
and even more fun farting about with Option<T> types.  I might go through at some later point and keep everything elevated throughout, there's an interesting OptionCase struc that I'd like to try and I dislike having to use Match().

But here we are, it works, it's okay, I enjoyed it.
